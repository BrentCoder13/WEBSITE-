  <!-- COMPANY BACKGROUND -->
  <section class="company-bg">
      <div class="bg-text">
          <p>Papz Baliciado Auto Care Center began as a small, mobile service personally handled by its CEO, Papz Baliciado. In the early years, he would travel from one place to another to provide automotive services, sometimes with only a few people to assist him. Most of the work—from mechanical repairs to maintenance—was done through his own skills, effort, and dedication.</p>
          <p>Despite starting with limited resources, the CEO’s hard work, perseverance, and commitment to quality service paid off. Through consistent customer satisfaction and word-of-mouth recommendations, the business steadily grew. What once started as a one-man operation eventually expanded into a full-scale auto care shop.</p>
          <p>Today, Papz Baliciado Auto Care Center has a large workshop, multiple skilled staff, and is regularly visited and recommended by many satisfied clients. The shop continues to uphold its mission of delivering reliable, honest, and high-quality automotive service to every customer who walks through its doors.</p>
